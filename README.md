A blogging site using Python, Jinja2, Google AppEngine and Google DataStore

I have created a simple blogging site. Its up and running now with some basic functionality. Over the next couple weeks, I will be adding a bunch of functionality to it, which will make it like a real blogging site.

Please take some time to go over it and try to visit it often to suggest improvements. Any suggestions are most welcome.

I will be uploading the source code to GITHUB pretty soon so you guys can view it.

Here is the link to the homepage:

Here is the link to add a new blog entry:

Don't be surprised if you view the homepage and do not see your entries. I will be messing with the database more often than you can imagine :-P.

Tools Used to Develop the Site:
Programming Language: Python (Backend)
Front End: Jinja2 (HTML templates similar to JSPs in Java)
Web Framework: Google AppEngine(Also used for hosting my site)
Database: Google DataStore (NoSQL Database Used primarily to scale)
Editor: Sublime Text 2



Future Work:
1. Add Authentication - Signup and Login
2. Login using Facebook API (This would avoid the users to create an account)
3. Link Pages better so users do not need to type the links(which is the current behavior)
4. Allow the users to edit/modify their post
5. Allow the users to delete their post
6. Allow users to comment on blog posts
7. Allow users to like other users blog posts
8. Rank the blog posts using a Hotness Algorithm like Reddit.com does
9. Rank the comments using Wilsons Interval or some similar algorithm.
10. Improve the design of the site! :-P (This is the most boring part! will probably try and delegate it to someone interested in improving the UI)
11. Add a line break after every 60-70 characters
